    /// <see cref="Behavior"/> is a specification of how its context <see cref="BehavioredClassifier"/> changes state over time. This specification may be either a definition of possible behavior execution or emergent behavior, or a selective illustration of an interesting subset of possible executions. The latter form is typically used for capturing examples, such as a trace of a particular execution.
