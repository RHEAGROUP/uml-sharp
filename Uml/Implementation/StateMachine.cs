    /// StateMachines can be used to express event-driven behaviors of parts of a system. Behavior is modeled as a traversal of a graph of Vertices interconnected by one or more joined Transition arcs that are triggered by the dispatching of successive Event occurrences. During this traversal, the StateMachine may execute a sequence of Behaviors associated with various elements of the StateMachine.
