    /// <see cref="Realization"/> is a specialized <see cref="Abstraction"/> relationship between two sets of model <see cref="Element"/>s, one representing a specification (the supplier) and the other represents an implementation of the latter (the client). Realization can be used to model stepwise refinement, optimizations, transformations, templates, model synthesis, framework composition, etc.
